### Code Contribution

Code Contribution can be
viewed [here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=SeanHoWB&breakdown=true).

Enhancements implemented:

1. Set up the initial structure to build our code base upon.
    - `AddCommand` class to allow users to add commands into `MindMyMoney`.
    - `CalculationInputCommand` class to allow users to calculate their expenses.
    - `Expenditure` class to store details of user expenditure .
    - `CreditCard` class to store details of user's credit card.
    - `AddCommandInputTests` class containing functions to test the inputs in AddCommand.
    - `Calculations` class containing calculation functions.
    - `GeneralFunctions` class containing general functions.
    - `TimeFunctions` class containing functions used to parse time information.
    - Allows the team to use functions and classes essential to `MindMyMoney`.
      <br/><br/>
2. Added the `AddCommand` class.
    - Allows users to track and add their expenditure in `MindMyMoney`, and see a summary of all the inputs they have
      added.
    - Added its relevant `AddCommandInputTests` that serves as input validation and checks the input of each field in
      the add command for its validity.
      <br/><br/>
3. Set up the `CalculationInputCommand` class.
    - Calculates the total amount of expenditures done by a user, according to date.
    - Added `Calculations` class to perform the calculations needed by `CalculationInputCommand`.
    - Served as a basic foundation to calculation that was worked on further by teammate Jierui.
    - Provides the user with the ability to see the total expenditure on a particular date.
      <br/><br/>
4. Added`Expenditure` class.
    - Users are now able to track their sources of expenditure.
    - As a key functionality of `MindMyMoney`, users can now track their expenditures and get their total expenditure.
      <br/><br/>
5. Added `CreditCard` class.
    - Users are now able to input their various credit cards into `MindMyMoney`.
    - Being part of the value proposition of `MindMyMoney`, it allows users to track their multiple forms of payment.
      <br/><br/>
6. Added `GeneralFunction` class
    - Allows the team to call frequently used functions in `MindMyMoney` from just 1 class, increases OOP.
    - Implemented `findItemsInList` function that aided the search for expenditure by date and by category in
      `calculateExpenditurePerMonth`.
    - Implemented `parseInputWithCommandFlag` to parse user input containing flags. This was used throughout the code
      across many commands.
    - Implemented `capitalise`, `formatFloat` functions, to format user input.
      <br/><br/>
7. Added JUnit tests
    - Added JUnit tests to `AddCommand`, `ListCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, `CalculateInputCommand`,
      `GeneralFunctions`, `HelpCommand`, `DeleteCommand`,  `Parser`, `ByeCommand`, `MindMyMoney`, `Ui`.
    - Increased the test coverage for these classes to 88% classes and 87% lines covered
    - Implemented functions to allow capturing of terminal output, used throughout other JUnit tests.
      <br/><br/>
8. Miscellaneous
    - Fixed bugs raised during PE-Dry testing pertaining to inconsistent UG images.
    - `ExpenditureCategoryType` enum for containing the types of category of expenditure.
    - `ExpenditureFields` enum for containing the fields in an add expenditure command.
    - `Indexes` class containing constants referencing indexes used in arrays.
      <br/><br/>
